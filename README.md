# 👋 Welcome to My DevOps Portfolio

Hi, I'm **Tudor**, a DevOps Engineer and Team Leader with over **10 years of experience** designing, automating, and operating infrastructure across cloud-native and on-prem environments.  
This repository is my technical portfolio — a collection of real-world examples, demos, labs, and reusable components reflecting my work with **Kubernetes, OpenStack, CI/CD, Terraform, Ansible, monitoring, and automation**.
